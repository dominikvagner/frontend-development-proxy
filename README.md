# Frontend Development Proxy

<!-- [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/quay.io-dvagner%2Fconsoledot--testing--proxy-red)](https://quay.io/repository/dvagner/consoledot-testing-proxy) -->

Configurable container proxy for UI/E2E testing, implemented using the
[caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) proxy extended with a custom header transforming
extension.

## Usage

This container proxy will expose a [env | stage].foo.redhat.com:[port | 1337]
endpoint that will proxy request to routes defined by you and the rest to the
chosen consoledot environment. \

Usage (testing against stage):

```sh
podman run -d
  -e HTTPS_PROXY=$RH_STAGE_PROXY_URL
  -p 1337:1337
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/config:ro,Z"
  frontend-development-proxy quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/hcc-platex-services-tenant/frontend-development-proxy:latest

```

## Setup

All you really need is Podman or Docker and the app you want to test :)

### Hosts setup

In order to access the https://[env].foo.redhat.com in your browser, you have
to add entries to your /etc/hosts file. This is a one-time setup that has to
be done only once (unless you modify hosts) on each machine.

For each env you will need to add this to your `/etc/hosts` file, default env is
'stage':

```sh
127.0.0.1 [env].foo.redhat.com
::1 [env].foo.redhat.com
```

## Configuration

This proxy has configurable routes and the consoledot (HCC) environment

### Routes

The proxy can be configured for your apps/needs by providing a JSON configuration
file that defines the to-be proxied routes and a flag for endpoints that require
the RH identity header (APIs for example might, but not the static files), these
RH identity headers are automatically used for routes that start with `/api/`, you
can disable that by setting the `rh-identity-headers` flag to false.

This proxy is meant to be used along a locally running console app in the static
mode, i.e.: in your app run `npm|yarn fec static` or `npm start:federated` depending
on your setup. And if you want also your backend.

By default the container will expect the routes JSON config in `/config/routes.json`,
but if needed this can be changed by setting the `ROUTES_JSON_PATH` environment
variable. \

Example:

```jsonc
{
  // STATIC FILES FE
  "/apps/NAME-OF-YOUR-APP*": { "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8003" }, // this will proxy to a serer that runs on your machine at localhost:8003
  // YOUR BACKEND API
  "/api/NAME-OF-YOUR-APP/*": { "url": "http://host.docker.internal:8000" },
}
```

#### Using a locally running Chrome UI

For development with locally running Chrome UI
([insights-chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome)) you need
to add a new route into the routes config that points to a server which serves
the chrome UI static files under the correct route and that has the `is_chrome`
flag set.

```jsonc
{
  "/apps/chrome*": {
    "url": "http://host.docker.internal:9912",
    "is_chrome": true, // this will enable the HTML fallback handle needed by the chrome UI
  },
}
```

You can start a server which will serve the chrome static files like so:

```sh
❯ npx http-server ./build -p 9912 -c-1 -a :: --cors=\*

# Beware that the build folder needs to have the static file in the
# `build/apps/chrome/` directory.
❯ ls build/apps/chrome/
.  ..  index.html  js

```

### Environment

The environment can be configured by setting the `HCC_ENV_URL` to something
different than the default of `console.stage.redhat.com` and all the uncatched
requests by your routes/matchers will be directed there.
Other than that you can also set `HCC_ENV` and `HCC_PORT` variables that just
change the exposed URL you are gonna be using.

For testing against stage you will also need to set the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment
variable to the RH stage proxy URL.

## DinD (docker-in-docker CI)

If your CI is a docker-in-docker setup, then there is a problem with using the
`host.docker.interal` addresses for targeting the services outside of the container.
This can be resolved by binding the container directly to the Podman/Docker host's
network, with no network isolation, which is why you might need to run it as root/superuser.
And changing the routes to `127.0.0.1`.

```sh
sudo podman run -d
  -e HTTPS_PROXY=$RH_STAGE_PROXY_URL
  -v "$(pwd)/config:/config:ro,Z"
  --network=host
  frontend-development-proxy quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/hcc-platex-services-tenant/frontend-development-proxy:latest
```
